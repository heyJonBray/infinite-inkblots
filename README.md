# Infinite Inkblots

## About

## TODO

- [ ] output svg instead of raster
- [ ] trait extraction for metadata
- [x] add a frame around image (color deterministic)
- [ ] gold frame for '420' and "69" addresses

## Try

- [ ] more organic appearance
- [ ] "ink bleeding"
- [ ] asymmetric decay
- [ ] color palettes: monochrome (blue/black), duotone (blue + black)
- [ ] gradient opacity fill
- [ ] feathered edges for soaked-ink effect
- [ ] layered ink passes with different radii, density, pattern

### For another project

- [ ] try mirrored cellular automaton/flow simulation pixel-style

## Traits

- seed
- splatter
- frame
